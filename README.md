# King_County_Flood_Risk
Want to buy a home in King County? Are you at risk for flooding? How will your home hold value in a flood? Lets find out.


## Problem statement

As a data scientist, I have been tasked with helping middle-high income to middle-income home buyers purchase a home that will have minimal flood damage. The buyers are focused on the retention of the home value over time, how it will change, and how the risk of flooding will diminish their home assets.
To do this I looked at: 

1.  How do flood scores affect home prices?

2. Which house attributes increase the sale price?

3. Will a change in sea level creating new waterfront properties affect home value?


# Components

* **Jupyter Notebook**

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jj862/King_County_Flood_Risk/edit/main/README.md) is our key deliverable and contains details of our approach and methodology, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building and validation. 

 Big_book_1 and Big_book_2 are Jupyter note books with non-directional EDA. They were primarily used to prepare data for the student.ipynb notebook. 

* **Presentation**

The [presentation](https://github.com/jj862/King_County_Flood_Risk/blob/main/Your%20big%20idea.pdf) gives an overview of the findings of the data and recommendations of which homes to purchase.  It is aimed to be between 5  long.
