# King_County_Flood_Risk
Want to buy a home in King County? Are you at risk for flooding? How will your home hold value in a flood? Lets find out.


## Problem statement

As a data scientist, I have been tasked with helping middle-high income to middle-income home buyers purchase a home that will have minimal flood damage. The buyers are focused on the retention of the home value over time, how it will change, and how the risk of flooding will diminish their home assets.
To do this I looked at: 

1.  How do flood scores affect home prices?

2. Which house attributes increase the sale price?

3. Will a change in sea level creating new waterfront properties affect home value?
